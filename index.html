            <h3 id="software">What is software components?</h3>
            <p id="software-intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>&#9745;</span> Software components are the set of instructions that we store and run on our hardware. It direct the computer to proform a specific task. In other words, the software is a computer program that communicates with computer to do the operations we want it to do.</p>
            <h3 id="hardware">What is hardware components?</h3>
            <p id="hardware-intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>&#9745;</span> Hardware is general term to describe the various physical components that are essential part of the every cpmputer system. The hardware components are the actual part of the computer system that are visable to us and we can use hardware divice to operate the computer.</p>

            <h3 class="motherboard">What is motherboard?</h3>
            <p class="motherboard-definations">A motherboard (also called mainboard, main circuit board, MB, mboard, backplane board, base board, system board, mobo, or, in Apple computers, logic board) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general use.</p>

        <div id="CPU-information">
            <h3 class="CPU">What is CPU?</h3>
            <p class="CPU-definations">A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor, or just processor, is the most important processor in a given computer. Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations. This role contrasts with that of external components, such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and specialized coprocessors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).</p>

            <h3 class="CPU-heatsink">What is CPU Heatsink?</h3>
            <p class="CPU-heatsink-definations">A heat sink (also commonly spelled heatsink,) is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant, where it is dissipated away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of the device's temperature. In computers, heat sinks are used to cool CPUs, GPUs, and some chipsets and RAM modules. Heat sinks are used with other high-power semiconductor devices such as power transistors and optoelectronics such as lasers and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), where the heat dissipation ability of the component itself is insufficient to moderate its temperature.</p>

            <h3 class="hard-drive">What is Hard Drive?</h3>
            <p class="hard-drive-definations">A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk, is an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage with one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data when powered off. Modern HDDs are typically in the form of a small rectangular box.</p>

            <h3 class="optical-drive">What is Optical Drive?</h3>
            <p class="optical-drive-definations">In computing, an optical disc drive is a disc drive that uses laser light or electromagnetic waves within or near the visible light spectrum as part of the process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs. Some drives can only read from certain discs, but recent drives can both read and record, also called burners or writers (since they physically burn the organic dye on write-once CD-R, DVD-R and BD-R LTH discs). Compact discs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by such drives.</p>

        <div id="floppy-drive-information">
            <h3 class="floppy-drive">What is Floppy Drive?</h3>
            <p class="floppy-drive-definations">A floppy disk or floppy diskette (casually referred to as a floppy or a diskette) is a type of disk storage composed of a thin and flexible disk of a magnetic storage medium in a square or nearly square plastic enclosure lined with a fabric that removes dust particles from the spinning disk. Floppy disks store digital data which can be read and written when the disk is inserted into a floppy disk drive (FDD) connected to or inside a computer or other device.</p>

            <p class="SMPS-power-supply-definations">A switched-mode power supply (SMPS), also called switching-mode power supply, switch-mode power supply, switched power supply, or simply switcher, is an electronic power supply that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently.</p>

        <div id="system-cooling-fan-information">
            <h3 class="system-cooling-fan">What is System Cooling Fan?</h3>
            <p class="system-cooling-fan-definations">A computer fan is any fan inside, or attached to, a computer case used for active cooling. Fans are used to draw cooler air into the case from the outside, expel warm air from inside and move air across a heat sink to cool a particular component. Both axial and sometimes centrifugal (blower/squirrel-cage) fans are used in computers. Computer fans commonly come in standard sizes, such as 92 mm, 120 mm (most common), 140 mm, and even 200â€“220 mm. Computer fans are powered and controlled using 3-pin or 4-pin fan connectors.</p>

            <h3 class="GPU">What is GPU?</h3>
            <p class="GPU-definations">A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit initially designed to accelerate computer graphics and image processing (either on a video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles). After their initial design, GPUs were found to be useful for non-graphic calculations involving embarrassingly parallel problems due to their parallel structure. Other non-graphical uses include the training of neural networks and cryptocurrency mining.</p>

            <p class="sound-card-definations">A sound card (also known as an audio card) is an internal expansion card that provides input and output of audio signals to and from a computer under the control of computer programs. The term sound card is also applied to external audio interfaces used for professional audio applications.</p>
